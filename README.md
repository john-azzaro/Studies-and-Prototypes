CRUD operations are common HTTP methods for communicating with a given server. CRUD operations allow you to make queries in the server's JavaScript code using Mongooseand can be peformed anywhere in your code. For example, the *read* CRUD operation refers to when the client request a document and send a *GET* request. 

In the case of this study, Mongoose has a few ways to *get* the document (stored on MongoDB). This applies to *create* (i.e. POST), *update* (i.e. PUT), and *delete* (i.e. DELETE) as well.
